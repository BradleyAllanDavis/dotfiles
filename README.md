# Dotfiles 2.0

Welcome to my new dotfiles based on Nix flakes!

This is a work in progress as I port over my existing dotfiles to Nix/NixOS.

## TODOs

- [ ] Parameterize nixpkgs for consumption by both macOS and NixOS.
- [ ] Migrate macOS preferences
- [ ] 

## Darwin

Use Determinate Systems nix-installer to install Nix.

## Top Dotfiles

These are other peoples' dotfiles that have elements I want to emulate.
