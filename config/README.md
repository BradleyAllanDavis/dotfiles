# Config files

These are config files for various applications/platforms as dictated by the XDG standard.
Many of these applications expect that config files are located exactly in their specific directory.
Even for applications that do not, I have moved configuration files to a corresponding directory.
I have tried to consolidate as much as I can in this directory to keep the main directory simpler.
